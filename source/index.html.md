title: Welcome to the 2015 workshop on visualization for decision making under uncertainty
---

The goal of this full-day workshop is to call on the research community to
discuss the state-of-the-art and research challenges for supporting modeling
and decision making under uncertainty in the computational and data sciences.
The workshop will be held on ???, 2015, as a one-day workshop at IEEE VIS 2015
in Chicago. All registered attendees of VisWeek will be able to attend the
workshop.

## Workshop announced!

We are excited to announce the 2015 workshop on visualization for decision
making under uncertainty which will be held at the IEEE VIS 2015 conference in
Chicago, IL on ???, 2015. The workshop will bring together researchers from
visualization and scientific domains where uncertainty — whether it is
model-based uncertainty or data-based uncertainty — needs to be analysed to
enable an improved predictability of relevant events as well as their
sensitivity to specific input model parameterizations.
