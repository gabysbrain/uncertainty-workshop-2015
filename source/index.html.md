title: Welcome to the 2015 workshop on visualization for decision making under uncertainty
---

This workshop calls on the research community to discuss the
state-of-the-art and research challenges for supporting modeling and
decision making under uncertainty in the computational and data
sciences. When  creating visual tools for simulations, challenges
exist in the uncertainty analysis (UA) of ensembles, the  sensitivity
analysis (SA) of input-output models, and the decision making process
that requires the understanding of risk stemming from both UA and SA. 

Over the last few years we have seen many different attempts to
address these issues, and it is now time to review the achievements in
the light of real-world applications. We therefore attempt to broaden
the focus of uncertainty analysis to a more comprehensive approach to
modeling and discuss the current and future requirements from an
application-oriented perspective.

## Workshop announced!

We are excited to announce the 2015 workshop on visualization for decision
making under uncertainty which will be held at the IEEE VIS 2015 conference in
Chicago, IL. The workshop will bring together researchers from
visualization and scientific domains where uncertainty — whether it is
model-based uncertainty or data-based uncertainty — needs to be analysed to
enable an improved predictability of relevant events as well as their
sensitivity to specific input model parameterizations.
