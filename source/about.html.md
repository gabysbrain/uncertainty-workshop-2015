The goal of this full-day workshop is to call on the research community to
discuss the state-of-the-art and research challenges for supporting modeling
and decision making under uncertainty in the computational and data sciences.
The workshop will be held at IEEE VIS 2015 
in Chicago. All registered attendees of VisWeek will be able to attend 
the workshop.

# Motivation

The goals of this workshop are three-fold: a) to identify what methods and
techniques have been successfully deployed into application domains, b) to
understand when and why methods have failed or are not in use, c) to broaden
the scope of work from mere ensemble analysis to support sensitivity analysis
as well as the decision making process based on computational model.

Uncertainty is often talked about in numerous fields, however the meaning,
definition, and usage highly varies between these fields. The relationship
between uncertainty and parameter space analysis is also up to debate; it is
clear a relationship exists, however the extent of this relationship is
unclear. Uncertainty analysis (UA) can be thought of as an essential component
of modeling and decision making. The underlying computational models have an
inherent parameter space in which to explore and the ensembles are in fact
comprised of several realizations of these models for varying parameters.
Additional challenges lie in the sensitivity analysis (SA) of the models and
both UA and SA are essential components to the decision making process. Other
aspects of the decision making process include trading off multiple objectives
as well as ranking of multiple possible solutions.

To better understand the issues relating to uncertainty and parameter space, we
must first survey what has been done, to date, to successfully handle the
expression of uncertainty in practical applications. We believe the best way to
assess this is to invite workshop participants to join in the conversation by
presenting their successes and failures and bring in domain experts to help us
understand how we, as visualization experts, can best address their needs.

The technical scope of this workshop will be determined by the accepted
short-papers, however our invited domain speakers will ensure an alternative
perspective to the problem. We will particularly target the inclusion of all
visualization participants to encourage greater communication between the
subfields. Specifically, work in decision making, cognition and perception, and
model building will be requested since understanding in these areas is
fundamental in progressing the state of the art. 

Some of the questions we would like to ask include:

* Are the current tools we see in visualization venues currently being used in the targeted field?
* What are the expert evaluations of these tools?
* What was learned from these deployments?
* Are we answering the questions for which our tools were designed?
* What are the new challenges in uncertainty and parameter space visualization?
* What are the open topics and continuing challenges?
* What happens (or has happened) to a tool in 5, 10years?
* Is visualization what is important, or are the questions being asked more important?
* Did we change the visualization pipeline for uncertainty?
* Does the visual encoding aide in the decision making
* Are there perceptual/cognitive issues that we are ignoring?
