The goal of this full-day workshop is to call on the research community to
discuss the state-of-the-art and research challenges for supporting modeling
and decision making under uncertainty in the computational and data sciences.
The workshop will be held ???, 2015, as a one-day workshop at IEEE VIS 2015 
in Chicago. All registered attendees of VisWeek will be able to attend 
the workshop.

# Motivation

The goals of this workshop are three-fold: a) to identify what methods and
techniques have been successfully deployed into application domains, b) to
understand when and why methods have failed or are not in use, c) to broaden
the scope of work from mere ensemble analysis to support sensitivity analysis
as well as the decision making process based on computational model.

Uncertainty is often talked about in numerous fields, however the meaning,
definition, and usage highly varies between these fields. The relationship
between uncertainty and parameter space analysis is also up to debate; it is
clear a relationship exists, however the extent of this relationship is
unclear. Uncertainty analysis (UA) can be thought of as an essential component
of modeling and decision making. The underlying computational models have an
inherent parameter space in which to explore and the ensembles are in fact
comprised of several realizations of these models for varying parameters.
Additional challenges lie in the sensitivity analysis (SA) of the models and
both UA and SA are essential components to the decision making process. Other
aspects of the decision making process include trading off multiple objectives
as well as ranking of multiple possible solutions.

# Planned activities

We will have a call for extended abstracts/short papers with the goal of 4
sessions of 10 minute presentations by participants. We will also invite 4
application domain speakers to give brief 30 minute talks. The goal of the
sessions is to steer discussion, and thus there will be plenty of time allotted
for conversation. We plan to publish the 2-page abstracts to the Vis
conference USB, however we will also invite worthy submissions to a special
issue of a journal (possible options below). We hope this will entice
participation of the workshop. In addition, we would like to highlight papers
accepted to the VisWeek tracks as thematic to encourage interest to uncertainty
visualization/parameter space work that will be presented throughout the rest
of the week and possibly give those authors a chance to present a
fast-forward at our workshop. Finally, we would like to use the workshop as a
mechanism for reaching out to the domain fields. We intend to use what we learn
from the discussions and talks to identify target communities in need of
visualization research and begin to build bridges to those areas.
