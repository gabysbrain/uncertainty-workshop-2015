# Anchoring survey

For those who estimated the length of the Danube River during the workshop,
thank you for taking part in an anchoring and adjustment (cognitive bias)
experiment. Although it was just for fun, the results are really good with a AI
(Anchoring Index) of 0.77 and demonstrate that when a person is uncertain about
the answer to a question, they often involuntary take a readily available
value, in this case the number of the question sheet, 300 or 3000.  Yes, there
were 2 different question sheets! Having got the value, they will usually
deviate from this in the appropriate direction but not very far. This is the
adjustment cognitive bias. The results and an explanation are presented
below:
