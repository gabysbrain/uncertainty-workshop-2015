# Call for papers

This workshop calls on the research community to discuss the state-of-the-art
and research challenges for supporting modeling and decision making under
uncertainty in the computational and data sciences. When  creating visual tools
for simulations, challenges exist in the uncertainty analysis (UA) of
ensembles, the  sensitivity analysis (SA) of input-output models, and the
decision making process that requires the understanding of risk stemming from
both UA and SA. 

Over the last few years we have seen many different attempts to address these
issues, and it is now time to review the achievements in the light of
real-world applications. We therefore attempt to broaden the focus of
uncertainty analysis to a more comprehensive approach to modeling and discuss
the current and future requirements from an application-oriented perspective.

We invite authors to submit short (2-page) papers on issues surrounding
uncertainty in visualization, leading to a  20-minute presentation.  Our goal
is to have an open discussion on successes, failures, and goals for the future
of uncertainty and parameter space visualization. Of special interest is the
deployment and use of tools from our field within application domains.

## Topics of interest

Topics of interest and questions we would like to ask include, but are not limited to:

* use-cases of existing and/or previously published methods
* reports on the effectiveness or evaluation of common techniques
* reflections on decision making under uncertainty
* observations on interactions with application specialists
* modifications of techniques for specific domains
* design choices for decision making and visual representations
* design processes 
* cognitive and perceptual aspects
* Are the current tools we see in visualization venues currently being used in the targeted field?
* What are the expert evaluations of these tools?
* What was learned from these deployments?
* Are we answering the questions for which our tools were designed?
* What are the new challenges in uncertainty and parameter space visualization?
* What are the open topics and continuing challenges?
* What happens (or has happened) to a tool in 5, 10 years?
* Is visualization what is important, or are the questions being asked more important?
* Did we change the visualization pipeline for uncertainty?
* Does the visual encoding aide in the decision making?
* Are there perceptual/cognitive issues that we are ignoring?
